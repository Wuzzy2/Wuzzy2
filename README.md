My name is Wuzzy and I’m strong supporter of free software. Because of this, my activity on GitHub is limited. I only use it to contribute to other free software projects like Minetest.

**You will not find my own code here.** (No, forks created exclusively for pull requests don’t count.) My own code is hosted on **[Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/Wuzzy)**.

## GitHub is bad

**I reject GitHub** because [GitHub is not free software](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/essays/github/) and suffers from [the JavaScript Trap](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html).

If the free software movement wants to truly win, we have to go **free software all the way**. It is unacceptable we’re tolerating a massive proprietary platform like GitHub and have integrated in our workflow so deeply.

### Moving away from GitHub

**If your project is on GitHub and you care about freedom, please consider migrating to a free platform.** The more people embrace *actual* freedom, the easier it will become for all of us.

**I recommend [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org)**. It is run by people who are *very* pro-free-software, has a very similar interface, easy migration and is very stable. I have had *very* good experience with it. We free software people have to stick together. :-)

Before you actually migrate, please make sure to read their documentation first in order to avoid ugly surprises.

Alternatively, consider self-hosting.

### Why I still use GitHub

In one word, compromise. In an ideal world, I could just abandon GitHub. However, that would not actually accomplish anything. Reasons why I still use GitHub include:

* **Reach out** to free software projects in order to convince them to move
* Be able to **contribute** to certain projects (like Minetest) at all and report bugs
* **Complain** about GitHub :-)
* And finally, it’s still *kinda* usable without running JavaScript, but it’s very buggy and I have to fall back to workarounds (but this is PAIN)
